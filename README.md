This is a Fullstack project that serves as a prototype for a restaurant menu application. The Backend is developed using Java with Spring Boot, while the Frontend is built using React.js. The project utilizes a local PostgreSQL database to manage and store menu data.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
Frontend: React.js
Database: PostgreSQL (local instance)

Running the Project:

1. Backend Setup:

a. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE.
b. Ensure that PostgreSQL is running and the database is set up with the required schema.
c. Run the Spring Boot application from IntelliJ by executing the main class (Cardapio Application)

2. Frontend Setup: 

a. Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal.
b. npm run dev

3. Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the application in your web browser: http://localhost:5173/
